Slide 2: Title Slide
Hello everyone.
I’m Rukonuzzaman Topu,student of CSE department, Green University of Bangladesh.Today I’m presenting my project progress  “Path Finding and Navigation System.”

Slide 3: Project Goals
The main goal of my project is to build a smart system that can find the best path in a grid, even when there are obstacles.
This can help in real-world areas like delivery, traffic systems, and emergency Transport.
I wanted to reduce human work and make the system smart enough to take its own decisions.

Slide 4: output 
"This is my project running.
On the left, you see buttons and sliders.
You can start the search, reset, or make a new map.
You can also choose the algorithm and set the grid size, speed, and how many blocks will be walls.
On the right side is the grid.
The green box is the starting point.
The black boxes are walls.
The program will find the best way from start to end without hitting walls."

Slide 5: Algorithms Used
Right now, I have added Dijkstra’s and A-star (A)* algorithms.
Both work well and show different searching styles.
 I will add two more algorithms like BFS and DFS to improve the system and give more options to the user.

 

Slide 6: Thank You
Thank you everyone for listening.
This is just the beginning. I hope to improve and apply this in bigger real-world projects.
